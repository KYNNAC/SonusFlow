# Sonus Flow

A hearing trainer application designed to help users retrain their natural auditory filtering abilities. This project aims to improve focus on important sounds in complex auditory environments by allowing users to manipulate and isolate audio layers from real-world ambiences.

**Technologies Used:**
* C++
* Qt (for GUI development)
* Git / GitHub (for version control)

**Current Status:**
* Project initialization complete.
* Development environment set up.
* Basic Qt application structure in place.

**Development Goals:**
* Backend: Implement robust audio loading, processing (filters, EQs), and mixing capabilities in C++.
* Frontend: Develop an intuitive user interface using Qt Widgets for interactive control of audio layers and effects.
* Learning & Skill Building: Focus on clean C++ code, good software design principles, and comprehensive testing.
* Localization: Plan to support multiple languages, including Portuguese (Brazil).
